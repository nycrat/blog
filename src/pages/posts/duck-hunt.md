## Context

These past few months have included some very big changes in my life, including
starting my first year at university. One pretty significant decision I had to
make was which clubs to join (or apply to) that I would enjoy, spend time on,
meet cool people, and learn from.

Out of the clubs I applied for positions at, one role that really interested me
was in a committee to organize the inaugural hackathon hosted by the [UBC
Science Undergraduate Society](https://www.susubc.ca/), and I was luckily
accepted to be a part of the team. The first few weeks were mostly
non-technical work like planning activities during the hackathon and reaching
out to clubs, sponsors, and companies. It was quite a new experience seeing how
structured the meetings were, how delegation of tasks happened, and also how
much networking is needed to put together a large event like this where you
need to know people from other clubs, organizations, and companies.

During one meeting, when brainstorming for activities during the hackathon, I
remembered back in high school when a teacher used an app called Goosechase
during a field trip to host a sort of digital scavenger hunt. This would be
perfect for our hackathon where we don't really want to spend lots of time and
resources setting up physical items for people to find, but just give
participants a list of activities or challenges to do. Plus, this would
encourage people to participate in the existing activities we have planned, and
not just spend the entire weekend coding while sitting at a table.

So, I started coming up with ideas for challenges and activities, and I started
creating an experience in Goosechase... until I looked at their pricing page:

(insert pricing image here)

For some reason, Goosechase has limits for the number of teams or individuals
that can participate, and the higher limits necessary for this hackathon
(150-200 people) are way over budget for this scavenger hunt idea. I shared
this news with the rest of the team, and while doing so, I took the opportunity
to say _"Hey, I can just make our own version of this app."_ And that leads us
to creating ~~Goosechase~~ [DuckHunt](https://github.com/nycrat/duck-hunt).
